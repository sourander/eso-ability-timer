# ESO ability timer
A small project that works on PS4 version of ESO. It mimics similar ability timer addons available on PC. It keeps track of when you have activated an ability and creates an animated bar based on the time data.

## Requirements
This project requires that you have ffmpeg installed with Blackmagic SDK. The code has been tested with FFmpeg 2.1.0 and Blackmagic Desktop 11.4 (and same version for SDK). My setup during dev phase was:
 * PC with Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop
 * Blackmagic Intensity Pro 4K capture card
 * PS4 Pro with Elder Scrolls Online

## Todo
I will add others skills to the tracker. No new features planned at the moment; this was a fun one weekend project.
